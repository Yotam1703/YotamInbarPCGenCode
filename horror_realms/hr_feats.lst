##Bardic Masterpieces Abilities
Stone Face				KEY:Masterpiece ~ Stone Face				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DESC:By filling your performance with the mournful angst of a lost love, your song evokes the inexorable pull of the grave upon every living thing.	DESC:All living creatures you select within 30 feet at the start of your turn each round gain 2 negative levels unless they succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = %1). This is a death effect and a sonic effect. This performance has audible components. Use: 3 rounds of bardic performance. Action: 1 full round action.|10+(BardLVL/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Music Beyond the Spheres	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Music Beyond the Spheres	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DESC:You use your own life force to create a phantasmagorical impression of eldritch vibrations with your wild, flailing dance and erratic tones. The performance unravels and remakes the fabric of reality around you according to your designs.	DESC: When you enact this unnerving bardic performance, you take 2 points of Constitution drain or 2 points of Wisdom drain (your choice) to create an effect similar to limited wish, except that the effect is interpreted by an alien entity of the Dark Tapestry. If you have at least 17 ranks in Perform (dance, sing, or string), and you destroy a magic or technological item worth at least 25,000 gp as a material component and take 4 points of Constitution drain or Wisdom drain, you can instead produce the effects of a wish with this performance. The GM interprets how precisely the effects of this bardic performance are granted by the entity that you contact. This performance has audible and visual components. Use: 1 round of bardic performance. Action: 1 full round action.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Relentless Reprise		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Relentless Reprise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DESC:Your song replays endlessly in your target’s mind, sapping resolve and sanity.	DESC:Whenever you end a bardic performance, you can add a quick reprise that makes it unnaturally catchy. Any creature within 30 feet of you when you finish your performance will run the risk of having your tune replaying endlessly in its mind. Unless the creature succeeds on a Will saving throw (DC = %1), the tune distracts it for %2 days. The creature takes a –4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and Perception checks as long as it remains distracted. The creature’s sleep also becomes fitful, requiring half again as long for the usual benefit and entirely negating the benefits of full bed rest beyond a normal rest. Once per day upon waking after rest, the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw to shake off the relentless reprise. If it fails, the creature takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d4 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules from Horror Adventures). This is a curse effect with audible components. Use: 1 round of bardic performance. Action: 1 immediate action.|10+(BardLVL/2)+CHA|BardLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.8

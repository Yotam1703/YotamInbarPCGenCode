##Arcanist Exploits ("Exploits of the Outer Rifts")
Blood Tears			KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Blood Tears			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During this time, the arcanist’s vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that creature does not gain concealment against him. At a distance of greater than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand, splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn’t wipe his bleeding tears away, the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of %2 minutes.|ArcanistExploitDC|ArcanistLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Damnation Susurrus	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Damnation Susurrus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to manifest a choir of insidious whispers, which echo in the mind of a single target within 30 feet, urging the target to harm itself. A creature that fails a Will save (DC %1) to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level (total %2 targets). Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.|ArcanistExploitDC|DamnationSusurrusTargets	DEFINE:DamnationSusurrusTargets|0	BONUS:VAR|DamnationSusurrusTargets|(ArcanistLVL/3)+1	SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Fiendish Proboscis	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Fiendish Proboscis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist’s face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for %1 rounds, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit’s effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis’s tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target’s magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir’s maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target’s life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target’s ability to use magic, the tongue’s unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.|ArcanistLVL	NATURALATTACKS:Fiendish Proboscis,Weapon.Natural.Weapon Group Natural.Melee.Finesseable.Touch,*1,0	SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Rift Fog			KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Rift Fog			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog’s supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the slow spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save (DC %1). Once created, rift fog persists for %2 rounds, or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.|ArcanistExploitDC|max(1,ArcanistLVL/2)	SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Shadows Out of Light	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Shadows Out of Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to pull fiendish essence from the Outer Rifts into his own shadow. Malformed and nearly amorphous, the shadow-things swarm across his body, turning his eyes completely black and distorting his physical form. These shadows persist for %1 rounds and grant the arcanist a +2 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. The shadows are threatening, and as long as they persist the arcanist is considered armed for the purpose of flanking or threatening an attack of opportunity. Whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the arcanist, he may make the attack of opportunity with his shadow, striking as a touch attack that deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + CHA plus 1 point of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC %2) negates the Strength damage. This ability does not itself increase the number of attacks of opportunity the arcanist can make in a round, but feats like Combat Reflexes do allow him to make multiple attacks of opportunity with his shadow. The shadows cannot be compelled to make normal attacks—they lash out in this way only as a reaction to being provoked.|max(ArcanistLVL/2,1)|ArcanistExploitDC	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Soulrider			KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Soulrider			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a “soulrider.” The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target’s subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (DC %1, this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell’s effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell’s effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. Detect magicand detect evil can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of status, and the creature takes a –2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per sending. Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.|ArcanistExploitDC	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Tentacles			KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Tentacles			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist’s arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist’s size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist’s Strength score. The arcanist’s reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Tentacle	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Mute				KEY:Mute Musician ~ Mute				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:A mute musician has a disability or injury (possibly self-inflicted or even psychological) that prevents her from speaking or vocalizing. Language-dependent effects (including Perform [oratory]) require the bard to be able to use telepathy, nonverbal languages, or writing to communicate. She cannot use Perform (sing) or speak languages, though she can still create audible bardic performances by means of a musical instrument. A mute musician can provide verbal and somatic components for spells she casts via any musical instrument in which she has ranks in the appropriate Perform skill.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9

##Bardic Performances
Maddening Harmonics	KEY:Mute Musician ~ Maddening Harmonics		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardFrighteningTune		DESC:At 14th level, the mute musician can create a performance so baffling and discordant that it usurps all thought within a 30-foot radius with chaos and entropy. The mute musician can select which creatures in this area are affected by the maddening harmonics and which are not. All targeted creatures within this area must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = %1) or be confused for as long as they can hear the performance. If the creature succeeds at its saving throw, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This performance relies on audible components. This bardic performance replaces frightening tune.|10+(BardLVL)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.9

All creatures in the area of effect gain a +%1 bonus on all saving throws made against sonic attacks or language-dependent effects. Symphony of silence relies on audible components.

Ceasless Performance	KEY:Mute Musician ~ Ceasless Performance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardInspireHeroics			DESC:At 15th level, the mute musician can continue taking the free action to maintain a bardic performance even while confused, cowering in fear, dazed, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, petrified, silenced, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. Even if the mute musician is killed, she can continue to take the free action to maintain her performance as long as she has rounds remaining. Only the utter destruction of the mute musician’s body (such as via destruction or disintegrate, or by reducing the bard to a negative hit point total equal to %1) causes the performance to end. This ability replaces inspire heroics.|10*CON	SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Song of the Conjunction	KEY:Mute Musician ~ Song of the Conjunction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardMassSuggestion			DESC:At 18th level, the mute musician can harmonize with the alien chorus beyond the music of the spheres, creating a portentous cosmic alignment. This effect duplicates a gate used to travel, save that the destination point must be on the same plane as the bard, but it is not otherwise limited by distance. This bardic performance replaces mass suggestion.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Insights From Beyond	KEY:Mute Musician ~ Insights From Beyond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardVersatilePerformance	DESC:[Unimplemented] At 2nd level, a mute musician adds two abjuration, conjuration (calling), conjuration (summoning), or conjuration (teleportation) spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of bard spells known. At 6th level and every 4 bard levels thereafter, she can choose two more spells to add to her spells known. This class feature replaces versatile performance.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Eldritch Caesura		KEY:Mute Musician ~ Eldritch Caesura		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardJackOfAllTrades		DESC:At 10th level, a mute musician can insert unsettling silences into her otherworldly music by spending an additional 1 round of bardic performance per round. This supernatural technique impossibly blurs the line between music and light, transmitting audible performances and sonic bard spells through most barriers save lead. This allows the music and sonic spells to affect creatures across planar boundaries (including on the Ethereal or Shadow Planes), vacuums, and areas of magical silence.This class feature replaces jack-of-all-trades.

Manifestation	KEY:Accursed Companion ~ Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CompanionClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An accursed companion’s unnatural condition manifests in one of the following ways, chosen at the time the companion is gained. Once selected, the choice cannot be changed. Who gets to choose the manifestation depends on the GM’s preference (the manifestation may even be randomly determined). All manifestations grant a boon in combat to the animal companion but a disadvantage to the master. An animal companion’s accursed manifestation can be activated in one of two ways: the companion’s master can deliberately trigger a manifestation by making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal or wild empathy check as a move action, or the manifestation can take place when a specific trigger occurs, as detailed in each manifestation’s entry. When an accursed companion manifests its condition, the companion’s master can resist or mitigate the debilitating side effect with a successful Will save (DC = %1). However, manifestations that are constant (such as festering flesh or unsavory friends) have an equally constant effect on the companion’s master, and these effects cannot be mitigated or resisted in any way. An accursed companion can only be affected by a manifestation once per hour unless the manifestation is constant. All side effects on an accursed companion’s master are mind-affecting effects.|10+(HD/2)+max(WIS,0)	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Accursed Companion Manifestation|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Bestial Flashes	KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Bestial Flashes	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The companion is haunted by the previous companion’s fear and pain during its death. This manifestation is triggered automatically whenever the accursed companion takes damage from a single blow in excess of %1 points of damage. When an accursed companion suffers bestial flashes, it gains a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made on natural attacks, and gains a +4 morale bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits. Once triggered, a bestial flash lasts for 1 minute. When a bestial flash occurs, the mind of the companion’s master is overwhelmed with images of feral savagery. She becomes confused for 1d4 rounds and is then sickened for the remainder of the minute that the bestial flash persists. On a successful Will save, the master is instead sickened for only 1d4 rounds.|HP/2	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Bloodthirsty	KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Bloodthirsty		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The companion becomes consumed with bloodlust that drives it into a frenzy of savage ferocity. This manifestation is triggered automatically whenever the accursed companion makes a successful critical hit with a natural attack. When the companion becomes bloodthirsty, it flies into a rage and gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, but it also takes a –2 penalty to its AC. The rage lasts until the battle is over or for 1 minute, whichever is shorter. It cannot end its rage voluntarily. The companion’s master is overwhelmed with rage as well for this period, although this rage is unfocused and distracting, preventing the master from doing anything but growling, hissing, shrieking, and making other animalistic howls, during which time the master cannot speak or use spells with verbal components. A successful Will save reduces the duration of the master’s rage to 1 round.	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Festering Flesh	KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Festering Flesh	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The companion looks horrific and smells worse. Its rancid flesh reeks of rot and crawls with fleas, ticks, and other vile parasites. Despite its obvious grotesqueness, the creature is quite affectionate, perhaps even overly and inappropriately so. This manifestation is always active—the accursed companion is immune to the sickened and nauseated condition. The master, on the other hand, becomes consumed by fears of contagion to the extent that she takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws against disease effects.	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Palsy			KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Palsy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The poor creature is stricken with palsy. It drools constantly and its muscles spasm with tics and twitches. The palsy doesn’t impact its abilities, and actually aids the accursed companion when it loses mobility from other sources. The first time each day that the accursed companion becomes paralyzed, grappled or otherwise has its movement impaired, a freedom of movement effect automatically activates on the accursed companion. This effect persists for 1 minute, during which time the companion’s master becomes nauseated unless she succeeds at a Will save (in which case she is merely sickened for the duration).	SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Rabid Vomit		KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Rabid Vomit		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Extraordinary	DESC:A crust of froth lines the rim of the accursed companion’s mouth. This manifestation is triggered automatically on the third round of any combat—on this round, the accursed companion always takes a standard action to vomit diseased pus and bile in a 15-foot cone (after moving, if it can, to capture as many enemies in the area of effect as possible). All creatures in this area must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = %1) or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds and contract rabies (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 87). On a successful save, the targets are merely sickened for 1d4 rounds. When the accursed companion makes this vomit attack, its master is overwhelmed by the sensation of a mouthful of diseased bile. She is stunned for 1 round and nauseated for 1d4 rounds thereafter unless she succeeds at a Will save, in which case she is merely sickened for 1d4 rounds.|10+(HD/2)+CON	SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Scavenger		KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Scavenger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:This companion is particularly intrigued by undeath, often playing with carcasses and presenting decaying body parts as gifts to its master. This manifestation is triggered automatically when the companion successfully damages a corporeal undead with a natural attack. For 1 minute, the companion gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against undead. During this time, the companion’s master becomes more susceptible to the undead, and takes a –2 penalty to all mind-affecting effects created by any undead creature.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Unexpected Frenzy	KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Unexpected Frenzy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The accursed companion looks normal, but some conditions or phrases cause the animal to fly into a murderous frenzy. When an accursed companion gains this condition, the GM determines three specific situations that can trigger the manifestation of the unexpected frenzy, such as a character petting the companion on the head, a keyword or key phrase such as “good dog,” or the sight of a specific type of creature within 10 feet. The first time each day one of the three triggers occurs, the accursed companion flies into its frenzy. Its eyes glow, and any sounds it makes take on an eerie, hollow echo. The companion acts as if under the effects of haste for 1d4 rounds before returning to normal, and it typically attacks the source of its trigger. While her companion is frenzied, the master is overwhelmed with shame and despair, suffering as if under the effects of a crushing despair spell for twice the length of the accursed companion’s frenzy. A successful Will save negates this effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Unsavory Friends	KEY:Accursed Companion Manifestation ~ Unsavory Friends	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AccursedCompanionManifestation.Supernatural	DESC:The companion manages to attract the company of less desirable species. It has an uncanny knack for finding centipedes, bats, mice, and other vermin, even in areas where such pests might not be all that common. Even more unusual, the companion makes it a habit to play with such creatures and becomes angry and defensive if anything threatens its vermin friends. This manifestation is constant. Immune to the distraction effect caused by all swarms, the animal companion is comfortable and even welcomes the nauseating sensation of its crawling friends. The companion’s master, unfortunately, never gets used to finding squirming bugs or wriggling maggots in the companion’s vicinity and takes a –4 penalty on all saving throws against any swarm’s distraction ability.

For monks who seek the truth hidden in pain, the practice of mortifications of the flesh helps to achieve enlightenment and acquire disturbing powers. Those who worship Zon-Kuthon tend to be particularly eager to explore the limitations of the flesh, yet monks of his faith are not the only ones to use self-mutilation and scarification to seek personal enhancement and power.

Mortifications	KEY:Scarred Monk ~ Mortifications	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkHighJump.MonkWholenessOfBody.MonkAbundantStep.MonkEmptyBody	DESC:Detailed below are a number of unusual, grisly, and harrowing processes known as mortifications that a monk can inflict upon herself in exchange for an unusual ki power. The monk must adhere to a philosophy that finds power in self-mortification; among the deities of the Inner Sea region, Zon-Kuthon’s devoted are the most associated with this practice, but other lawful faiths, such as those dedicated to the empyreal lords Neshen and Vildeis, the infernal duke Zaebos, or the whore queen Doloras, count mortifications among their approved methods of self-enlightenment. While mortal followers of the mysterious kyton demagogues are rare in the Inner Sea region, the kytons also encourage their monk worshipers to invest deeply in mortifications.A scarred monk chooses her first mortification at 4th level, selecting one from the list of potential mortifications detailed below. The scarred monk gains another mortification every 3 monk levels after this, to a maximum of six mortifications at 19th level. Once a scarred monk selects a mortification, she cannot change it. Some mortifications have prerequisites, such as already knowing certain mortifications or attaining a specific level (as noted in their descriptions).

Armor of Scars		KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Armor of Scars		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural	MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE											DESC:A scarred monk can force ki into her extensive scars, hardening them like armor.

Blood Eagle			KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Blood Eagle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:The monk’s rib bones are unusually prominent and press hideously against the flesh of her chest. As a swift action, she can spend 1 ki point to cause her ribs to break through her flesh, lacerating and tearing any opponent that has engaged her in a grapple attack or that has swallowed her whole. This does not cause the monk any damage; a few seconds after she extrudes them, the ribs retract into her body, leaving behind angry red welts. The ribs deal an amount of slashing damage equal to %1d%2 to any creature that is currently grappling her or has swallowed her whole. If the monk attempts to escape from that grapple in the same round, she adds the amount of damage her ribs inflicted to her Escape Artist or CMB check as a circumstance bonus.|PrimaryAttackDamageDice|PrimaryAttackDamageSize	SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Contortionist		KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Contortionist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:Over the years, the scarred monk has broken many of her bones and reset them at odd and repulsive angles to allow her to contort into entirely unnatural forms.

Doll Face			KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Doll Face		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Face Collector				DESC:When acquiring a new face with the face collector mortification (see below), the scarred monk can spend an additional 2 ki points to perform an eerie blood ritual that gives the stolen flesh the appearance of aged ceramic. When the face is stitched to her flesh, the monk gains the appearance of an aged porcelain doll, complete with cracked and peeling paint and a glassy, unblinking stare. A scarred monk with a doll face does not gain the bonus on Disguise checks but does gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per hour, the scarred monk can cause the doll face to shift and appear as the face of a lost loved one or friend of a single viewer within 30 feet—that targeted individual must succeed at a Will save (DC = %1) or become nauseated with fear for a number of rounds equal to %2. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Unlike a face of flesh, a doll face ages and cracks, falling off and restoring the scarred monk’s true and deformed face after 24 hours. A scarred monk must have the face collector mortification to take this mortification.|10+(MonkLVL/2)+CHA|ScarredMonkMortificationCount	SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Eyes Stitched Shut	KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Eyes Stitched Shut	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:The scarred monk can stitch her eyes shut. This takes 1 minute to accomplish, after which the monk is effectively blind. However, as long as the monk retains at least 1 point in her ki pool, she gains blindsense to a distance of 60 feet. She can detect living creatures with at least 1 point of damage within 30 feet of her as if via blindsight. The monk can remove the stitches as a full-round action to restore her normal sight and end this effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Face Collector		KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Face Collector		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:This mortification requires a monk to surgically remove the flesh from her face, surrendering her appearance and all associated identity. The flesh of her face heals into a featureless mass of scars at the end of this surgical ritual. Thereafter, at the cost of 1 ki point and as a standard action, the scarred monk can alter her facial features to duplicate those of a dead body she touches. The body must be of the same creature type as the scarred monk, and as her face changes, the corpse’s face withers away into rot and decay. This grants the scarred monk a +8 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual (although the penalties for gender, race, age, and size still apply). As a side effect to this unnatural shifting of appearance, a scarred monk gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against scrying effects. For 24 hours after claiming a new face, this bonus increases to +4.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Pain Binding		KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Pain Binding		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:By spending 1 ki point when she makes a single unarmed strike against a living creature as a standard action, the scarred monk can link her own pain to the creature struck. For a number of rounds equal to %1, any time the scarred monk takes lethal damage, the creature she has bound her pain to must succeed at a Will save (DC = %2) or take an equal amount of nonlethal damage.

As she does so, she exudes waves of agony in a 30-foot radius to deal damage equal to %1d%2+%3 to all creatures in the area of effect. A successful Will save (DC = %4) halves the damage, but on a failed Will save, a creature is sickened by the pain for 1 round.

Share Pain			KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Share Pain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:Whenever the monk takes damage from a weapon, she can spend 1 ki point as an immediate action to cause the body of her attacker to suffer the pain of that blow. The attacking creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = %1) or take damage equal to the amount the weapon blow inflicted on the monk and become staggered from the pain for 1 round as well. A successful saving throw halves the damage the attacker suffers from shared pain and negates the staggered effect.|10+(MonkLVL/2)+WIS	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Third Eye			KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Third Eye		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural	PRECLASS:1,Monk=13														DESC: The scarred monk bores a hole in her brow and then implants a mummified or alchemically preserved third eye in this opening.

A scarred monk must be at least 13th level to take this mortification.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Tongueless Master		KEY:Scarred Monk Mortification ~ Tongueless Master	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ScarredMonkMortification.Supernatural																		DESC:The monk assumes a vow of silence and slices out her own tongue. Thereafter, she wears the preserved appendage on a cord about her neck. She can no longer speak or cast spells with verbal components. Whenever she hits a creature with an unarmed strike, she can spend 1 point from her ki pool to steal the voice from her target. The target can resist this effect with a successful Will save (DC = %1), otherwise the victim loses the ability to speak or cast spells with verbal components for a number of minutes equal to %2. During this time, the scarred monk can speak in the victim’s voice.|10+(MonkLVL/2)+WIS|ScarredMonkMortificationCount	SOURCEPAGE:p.13

The monk can target any living creature within 60 feet who has been affected by share pain in the last 24 hours. The creature becomes stunned with pain for 1 round and then staggered for 1d3 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = %1).

The target can attempt a Will save (DC = %1) to negate the effect and immediately know the source of this harmful mental prying. Creatures that fail their saving throws are racked with pain, taking %2d6 points of damage. After successfully damaging a creature with this ability, the shaman can sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories as a full-round action and then attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim’s skill bonus rather than her own. If the victim wasn’t trained in the Knowledge skill the shaman wishes to use, then this check must be attempted as if untrained as well. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in the shaman’s mind %3 rounds, and the shaman can attempt one Knowledge check per round using these drained thoughts. This ability does not give access to memories or other personal information known by the victim. Brain drain is a mind-affecting effect. The shaman can use this ability %4 times per day|ShamanHexDC|ShamanLVL/2|WIS|ShamanBrainDrainTimes	DEFINE:ShamanBrainDrainTimes|0	BONUS:VAR|ShamanBrainDrainTimes|(floor(ShamanLVL/5))+1	SOURCEPAGE:p.16

These whispers utilize no known language, yet the victim nevertheless feels convinced that, somehow, it was almost able to comprehend the message. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = %1) or be confused for %2 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, the shaman cannot target that creature with this hex again for 24 hours.

Touch of the Void	KEY:Dark Tapastry Spirit ~ Touch of the Void	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shaman Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, the shaman is able to perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 +%1 points of cold damage. At 10th level, any creature the shaman strikes with this touch or with a melee weapon must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = %2) or be fatigued for %1 rounds.

Horrific Glimpse	KEY:Dark Tapastry Spirit ~ Horrific Glimpse	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:Once per day, the shaman can gain the effects of contact other plane after 1 hour of meditation. No components are required in order to use this ability, but the shaman does not get to select which plane she contacts. Instead, this version of the spell contacts an alien mind from somewhere in the Dark Tapestry, be it a hive mind of alien monstrosities, the disembodied sentience of a dead planet, or even the slumbering and insane mind of a Great Old One or Outer God. The shaman must succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom check rather than an Intelligence check to avoid a decrease in Intelligence or Charisma when using this ability. If she fails the check, her Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for 5 weeks, as the alien minds thus contacted prove as destructive to mortal thoughts as direct contact with the most powerful of deities. The types of answers provided by the horrific glimpse, be they true answers, ignorance, lies, or random answers, are considered equal to those of a greater deity if the questions being asked concern the Material Plane, but they are equal to those of a demigod if the questions posed concern any other plane. Also once per day (but only after first using this ability as per contact other plane), the shaman can reveal a fragment of this horrific vision to another creature, as per phantasmal killer, except that the target takes 1d4+1 points of Wisdom damage regardless of the results of any of its saving throws. The body of a creature slain by this effect is always hideously mutilated and savaged, making spells like speak with dead useless.	SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Unbound Form	KEY:Dark Tapastry Spirit ~ Unbound Form		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The shaman can assume a variety of forms, as per greater polymorph, for %1 minutes per day. The minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. When she assumes these forms, some element of the new shape always sets it apart from a typical specimen, such as strangely colored eyes, limbs that bend in unusual ways, or a slimy coating of mucus over the flesh.|ShamanLVL
Manifestation	KEY:Dark Tapastry Spirit ~ Manifestation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes an unnatural spirit of the Dark Tapestry. She gains damage reduction 5/— and immunity to acid, critical hits, and sneak attacks. While she retains much of her original appearance, several minor cosmetic changes leave no doubt as to her now-alien nature. Her eyes might appear as solid spheres of blackness, her fingers might writhe like tentacles, or her legs might bend backward at the knees.Once per day, the shaman can cast shapechange as a spell-like ability without requiring a material component, but the form the shaman assumes via this spell-like ability is never something that looks of natural origin to the shaman’s home world.
